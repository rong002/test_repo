This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r}
plot(iris)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

I have to ride on the back of a previous work to start this lecture because in my last work, the report did not come out all right.  So I tried to use an old work to test it out

# to calculate probability for Binomial Ramdon Value using R

### *X is Binomially distributed with n=20 trials p=1/6 probability of success: X~BIN(n=20, p=1/6).*

we can calculate the probability using the `dbinom` and `pbinom` functions. use the `Help(dbinom)` or`ï¼Ÿdbinom` to find out more about the function. **d...** can be use to find the `Probability density function`

suppose we would like to find p(X=3) *"p" is exactly equal to 3.*
```{r}
dbinom(x=3, size=20, p=1/6)
```
